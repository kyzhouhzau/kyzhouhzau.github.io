title:  Enriching Word Vectors With Subwords Information 
---

贡献：. In this paper, we propose a new approach based on the skipgram model, where each word is represented as a bag of character n-grams.  Our method is fast, allowing to train models on large corpora quickly and **allows us to compute word representations for words that did not appear in the training data.**
在这篇文章中，作者提出一种新的基于skipgram的模型，该模型中，每一个单词被表示成字符层面的n-grams的词袋模型。

1、计算单词连续表示的方法
