# Mimicking Word Embeddings using Subword RNNs

1、贡献点
In this paper, we present MIMICK,
an approach to generating OOV word
embeddings compositionally, by learning
a function from spellings to distributional
embeddings. Unlike prior work, MIMICK
does not require re-training on the original
word embedding corpus; instead, learning
is performed at the type level.
