# Mimicking Word Embeddings using Subword RNNs

1、贡献点
In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from spellings to distributional embeddings. Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning  is performed at the type level.

2、动机
However, it is not possible to enumerate the entire vocabulary of any language, and even large unlabeled datasets will miss terms that appear in later applications. The issue of how to handle these out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poses challenges for embedding-based methods. These challenges are     particularly acute when working with lowresource languages, where even unlabeled data may be difficult to obtain at scale. A typical solution is to abandon hope, by assigning a single OOV embedding to all terms that do not appear in the unlabeled data.

训练如框架中的模型，从字符层面学习，将输出向量与预训练的向量做损失计算，从而做更新。最终使得模型拥有预测未登录词词向量的能力
