# Mimicking Word Embeddings using Subword RNNs

1、贡献点
In this paper, we present MIMICK, an approach to generating OOV word embeddings compositionally, by learning a function from spellings to distributional embeddings. Unlike prior work, MIMICK does not require re-training on the original word embedding corpus; instead, learning  is performed at the type level.

2、动机
However, it is not possible to enumerate the entire vocabulary of any language, and even large unlabeled
datasets will miss terms that appear in later
applications. The issue of how to handle these
out-of-vocabulary (OOV) words poses challenges
for embedding-based methods. These challenges
are particularly acute when working with lowresource
languages, where even unlabeled data
may be difficult to obtain at scale. A typical solution
is to abandon hope, by assigning a single
OOV embedding to all terms that do not appear in
the unlabeled data.
